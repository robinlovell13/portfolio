          Hello! My name is Robin Lovell and I'm a passionate software engineer with a love for problem solving and human-centered design.
          My journey in the tech realm has led me to explore state-of-the-art technologies and develop creative applications.

          When I'm not coding, you can find me lifting weights, playing piano, learning Spanish, rolling in jiu jitsu, and more.
          Let's create something amazing together!
