          Hello! I'm a passionate software engineer with a love for creating innovative applications.
          My journey in the tech realm has led me to explore various technologies and push the boundaries of what's
          possible on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me weightlifting, playing jazz and classical piano, or learning Spanish.
          Let's create something amazing together!
